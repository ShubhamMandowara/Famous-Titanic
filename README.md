# Famous-Titanic
Work on famous Titanic Data set with 95% accuracy.
Firstly i started and know about data like nan, dtype. find out how many female, male survived.1. I did visualization of data in term of pclass, sex and age.2. And find out all no of people like from class 1 as male where = 122 for all.3. Filled age by pclass as i get to know that class 1 people age was more a by plot.4.  As cabin is having too much nan so i dropped from table.5. Also some values in embarked also nan so removed a those rows.6. Values like sex, embarked were changed to values and created a new dataset .7. Now imported data from test.csv and filled fare that is nan at one place to mean of fare 8. after this drop Cabin column and age is filled with same old method.9. i did logistic Regression method for prediction.10. i did testing of my prediction on same data original by making test and train data using.11. predicted  value and compared to original values and got 90% accurate12. find out prediction prediction = logr.predict(test_data) and compared to gender_submission.13. that is giving 95% accurate result for test data to fit to submission_data.
